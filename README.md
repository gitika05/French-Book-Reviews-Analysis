# French-Book-Reviews-Analysis

Project 1:

This Functional Analytics Project on French book review is about the application of NLP concepts, Hugging Face, VADER,Text Blob etc.

The French book review dataset from Kaggle consists of huge number of reader reviews of French books in French language. The data was collected using web scraping subjected to further data processing.

In this project, we tried doing sentimental analysis of the reviews using Hugging face, VADER and Text Blob for comparison.

We found that use of Hugging Face transformers have given the most relevant results.
